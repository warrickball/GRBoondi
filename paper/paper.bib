	abstractnote = {A century ago, Einstein formulated his elegant and elaborate theory of General Relativity, which has so far withstood a multitude of empirical tests with remarkable success. Notwithstanding the triumphs of Einstein's theory, the tenacious challenges of modern cosmology and of particle physics have motivated the exploration of further generalised theories of spacetime. Even though Einstein's interpretation of gravity in terms of the curvature of spacetime is commonly adopted, the assignment of geometrical concepts to gravity is ambiguous because General Relativity allows three entirely different, but equivalent approaches of which Einstein's interpretation is only one. From a field-theoretical perspective, however, the construction of a consistent theory for a Lorentz-invariant massless spin-2 particle uniquely leads to General Relativity. Keeping Lorentz invariance then implies that any modification of General Relativity will inevitably introduce additional propagating degrees of freedom into the gravity sector. Adopting this perspective, we will review the recent progress in constructing consistent field theories of gravity based on additional scalar, vector and tensor fields. Within this conceptual framework, we will discuss theories with Galileons, with Lagrange densities as constructed by Horndeski and beyond, extended to DHOST interactions, or containing generalized Proca fields and extensions thereof, or several Proca fields, as well as bigravity theories and scalar-vector-tensor theories. We will review the motivation of their inception, different formulations, and essential results obtained within these classes of theories together with their empirical viability.},

Starting with a flat space-time we show that for a special choice of the coefficients of the self-interactions the ghost-like pathologies disappear. For this we use the degeneracy condition of the Hessian. This constitutes the Galileon-type generalization of the Proca action with only three propagating physical degrees of freedom. The longitudinal mode of the vector field is associated to the usual Galileon interactions for a specific choice of the overall functions. In difference to a scalar Galileon theory, the generalized Proca field has more free parameters and purely intrinsic vector interactions. We then extend this analysis to a curved background. The resulting theory is the Horndeski Proca action with second order equations of motion on curved space-times.},

For the latter, suitable strategies have been employed in the last few years to successfully evolve the Cauchy problem at the level of the infrared theory, without the need for an explicit ultraviolet completion. We argue that the very same techniques can also be applied to self-interacting vector fields, avoiding a number of issues and ``pathologies'' recently found in the literature.}

We also obtain that the reduced \ensuremath{\chi}2 values in our model are close to unity when fitting with CMB and CMB+HST, illustrating that our model is a good candidate to describe the cosmological evolutions of the universe.}

We show that the theory may be extended by the addition of operators of the Generalized Proca class without spoiling the primary constraint that is necessary for consistency, allowing to interpolate between Generalized Proca operators and Proca-Nuevo ones. The constraint is maintained on flat spacetime and on any fixed curved background. Upon mixing extended Proca-Nuevo dynamically with gravity, we show that the constraint gets broken in a Planck scale suppressed way. We further prove that the theory may be covariantized in models that allow for consistent and ghost-free cosmological solutions. We study the models in the presence of perfect fluid matter, and show that they describe the correct number of dynamical variables and derive their dispersion relations and stability criteria. We also exhibit, in a specific set-up, explicit hot Big Bang solutions featuring a late-time self-accelerating epoch, and which are such that all the stability and subluminality conditions are satisfied and where gravitational waves behave precisely as in General~Relativity.}

The code supports non-trivial `many-boxes-in-many-boxes' mesh hierarchies and massive parallelism through the message passing interface.  evolves the Einstein equation using the standard BSSN formalism, with an option to turn on CCZ4 constraint damping if required. The AMR capability permits the study of a range of new physics which has previously been computationally infeasible in a full 3~+~1 setting, while also significantly simplifying the process of setting up the mesh for these problems. We show that  can stably and accurately evolve standard spacetimes such as binary black hole mergers and scalar collapses into black holes, demonstrate the performance characteristics of our code, and discuss various physics problems which stand to benefit from the AMR technique.}

	abstract     = {We present a new solver for coupled nonlinear elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs). The solver is based on pseudo-spectral collocation with domain decomposition and can handle one- to three-dimensional problems. It has three distinct features. First, the combined problem of solving the PDE, satisfying the boundary conditions, and matching between different subdomains is cast into one set of equations readily accessible to standard linear and nonlinear solvers. Second, touching as well as overlapping subdomains are supported; both rectangular blocks with Chebyshev basis functions as well as spherical shells with an expansion in spherical harmonics are implemented. Third, the code is very flexible: The domain decomposition as well as the distribution of collocation points in each domain can be chosen at run time, and the solver is easily adaptable to new PDEs. The code has been used to solve the equations of the initial value problem of general relativity and should be useful in many other problems. We compare the new method to finite difference codes and find it superior in both runtime and accuracy, at least for the smooth problems considered here.}

SpECTRE's goal is to achieve more accurate solutions for challenging relativistic astrophysics problems such as core-collapse supernovae and binary neutron star mergers. The robustness of the discontinuous Galerkin method allows for the use of high-resolution shock capturing methods in regions where (relativistic) shocks are found, while exploiting high-order accuracy in smooth regions. A task-based parallelism model allows efficient use of the largest supercomputers for problems with a heterogeneous workload over disparate spatial and temporal scales. We argue that the locality and algorithmic structure of discontinuous Galerkin methods will exhibit good scalability within a task-based parallelism framework. We demonstrate the code on a wide variety of challenging benchmark problems in (non)-relativistic (magneto)-hydrodynamics. We demonstrate the code's scalability including its strong scaling on the NCSA Blue Waters supercomputer up to the machine's full capacity of 22,380 nodes using 671,400 threads.}

As the third major category method to solve partial differential equations, finite element method is less frequently used in numerical relativity. In this paper, we design a finite element algorithm to solve the evolution part of the Einstein equations. This paper is the second one of a systematic investigation of applying adaptive finite element method to the Einstein equations, especially aiming for binary compact objects simulations. The first paper of this series has been contributed to the constrained part of the Einstein equations for initial data. Since applying finite element method to the Einstein equations is a big project, we mainly propose the theoretical framework of a finite element algorithm together with local discontinuous Galerkin method for the Einstein equations in the current work. In addition, we have tested our algorithm based on the spherical symmetric spacetime evolution. In order to simplify our numerical tests, we have reduced the problem to a one-dimensional space problem by taking the advantage of the spherical symmetry. Our reduced equation system is a new formalism for spherical symmetric spacetime simulation. Based on our test results, we find that our finite element method can capture the shock formation which is introduced by numerical error. In contrast, such shock is smoothed out by numerical dissipation within the finite difference method. We suspect this is partly the reason that the accuracy of finite element method is higher than the finite difference method. At the same time, different kinds of formulation parameters setting are also discussed.}

These requirements can only be satisfied if the simulations can be parallelized efficiently on a large number of processors and advanced computational strategies are adopted. To achieve this goal we have developed Simflowny, an open platform for scientific dynamical models which automatically generates parallel code for different simulation frameworks, allowing the use of HPC infrastructures to non-specialist scientists. One of these frameworks is SAMRAI, a mature patch-based structured adaptive mesh refinement infrastructure, capable of reaching exascale in some specific problems. Here we present the numerical techniques that we have implemented on this framework by using Simflowny in order to perform fast, efficient, accurate and highly-scalable simulations. These techniques involve high-order schemes for smooth and non-smooth solutions, Adaptive Mesh Refinement with arbitrary resolution ratios and an optimal strategy for the sub-cycling in time. We validate the automatically generated codes for the SAMRAI infrastructure with some simple test examples (i.e. wave equation and Newtonian MHD) and finally with the Einstein equations.}

To simulate dynamical spacetimes, GR-Athena++ uses the Z4c evolution scheme of numerical relativity coupled to the moving puncture gauge. We demonstrate stable and accurate binary black hole merger evolutions via extensive convergence testing, cross-code validation, and verification against state-of-the-art effective-one-body waveforms. GR-Athena++ leverages the task-based parallelism paradigm of Athena++ to achieve excellent scalability. We measure strong-scaling efficiencies above 95\% for up to \sim{}1.2 \texttimes{} 104 CPUs and excellent weak scaling is shown up to \sim{}105 CPUs in a production binary black hole setup with adaptive mesh refinement. GR-Athena++ thus allows for the robust simulation of compact binary coalescences and offers a viable path toward numerical relativity at exascale.}

The cosmological implications of such generalized Proca theories are investigated for both the background and the linear perturbation by taking into account the Lagrangian up to quintic order. In the presence of a matter fluid with a temporal component of  the vector field, we derive the background equations of motion and show the  existence of de Sitter solutions relevant to the late-time cosmic acceleration.  We also obtain conditions for the absence of ghosts and Laplacian instabilities of tensor, vector, and scalar perturbations in the small-scale limit. Our results are applied to concrete examples of the general functions in the theory, which encompass vector Galileons as a specific case. In such examples, we show that the de Sitter fixed point is always a stable attractor and study viable parameter spaces in which the no-ghost and stability conditions are satisfied during the cosmic expansion history.}

	abstract     = {We study static and spherically symmetric black hole (BH) solutions in second-order generalized Proca theories with nonminimal vector field derivative couplings to the Ricci scalar, the Einstein tensor, and the double dual Riemann tensor. We find concrete Lagrangians which give rise to exact BH solutions by imposing two conditions of the two identical metric components and the constant norm of the vector field. These exact solutions are described by either Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m (RN), stealth Schwarzschild, or extremal RN solutions with a non-trivial longitudinal mode of the vector field. We then numerically construct BH solutions without imposing these conditions. For cubic and quartic Lagrangians with power-law couplings which encompass vector Galileons as the specific cases, we show the existence of BH solutions with the difference between two non-trivial metric components. The quintic-order power-law couplings do not give rise to non-trivial BH solutions regular throughout the horizon exterior. The sixth-order and intrinsic vector-mode couplings can lead to BH solutions with a secondary hair. For all the solutions, the vector field is regular at least at the future or past horizon. The deviation from General Relativity induced by the Proca hair can be potentially tested by future measurements of gravitational waves in the nonlinear regime of gravity.}
